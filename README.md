# TransferSRNN

Here is an explanation of the files in this repo.

lossdiff_boxplot2.svg - Plot of difference between loss of respective fold and disease of baseline model and transfer model

baseline_losses.csv - Loss values for each fold and disease for baseline models

transfer_losses.csv - Loss values for each fold and disease for transfer models

transfer_feature_importance.csv - Feature importance table for transfer models across all diseases. Generated by iterating across all features and randomly shuffling one feature while holding all others constant. The more that the loss increases when shuffling a particular feature, the more important we can assume that feature to be.
